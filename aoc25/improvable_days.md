# Days to improve when I have time and feel like it

- [] Day 2 in general: Not sure how right now, but the execution takes multi-ms. Would be cool if at some point every single day runs in sub-ms.
- [] Day 4 part 2: I already asked AI for a better solution (I know I feel guilty too) and it gave me an efficent queue-based approach. But still multi-ms. Low priority, but again, would be cool if every day runs sub-ms.
- [] Day 8 part 1: Mostly brute force, maybe can optimize with some pre-checks and not computing every single distance (maybe slice the 3d structure into parts?), maybe use a heap or something
- [] Day 8 part 2: Similar to part 1, if I imporve somithing there, this should help here as well. I see even more potential for improvement here.
